### Genetic algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem

This project is an implementation of a genetic algorithm to approximate a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem. A genetic algorithm draws inspiration from the thoery of evolution by maintainig a set of possible solutions (the population) and applying successive reproduction, mutation, and selection steps to approximate a solution by optimising a given fitness function. This project is informed by the book [Introduction to Evolutionary Computing](http://www.evolutionarycomputation.org/).

Here's an example run of the algorithm:
